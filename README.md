# nodePostgreSQL
Expanding ApiRestExpress app using docker for postgresql and pgadmin engine,
integrating node-postgres, handling a pool of connections.
Then replacing the pool connection to an ORM (Sequelize) for more secure queries, defining models CRUD.
Later on we'll change the db to mysql and setup migrations. After migrating, i'll define relations 1-1, 1-many. many-many.
The idea is to set all the bases to add in the next repository auth.
